This guide delves into the **Tari Template Lib** library, showcasing how to build robust components for token management. We will start with warmup exercise and then we will explore three exercises, each focusing on a different type of resource: fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and confidential tokens. Through these exercises, you will learn how to initialize components, manage state, and implement essential functionalities like withdrawals and minting, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of token management in blockchain applications.

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Rust syntax and programming concepts.
- Basic familiarity with blockchain principles and token standards, including fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

## Exercise 1: Basic Counter Component

In this exercise, you will be working with a simple component named **Monerokon** using the **tari_template_lib** library. The component has a single piece of state, a **counter** of type `u32`. Follow these steps to complete the exercise:

1. Initialize component with a zero counter value
2. Implement the counter method to return the current value of the **counter**.
3. Implement the increase method to increment the counter value by 1.

## Exercise 2: Fungible Resource

Implement functionalities to manage a Fungible Resource Token. The component will have two vaults: a **supply_vault** and a **fee_vault**. Users can withdraw tokens from the **supply_vault** by paying a flat **FEE**. Follow these steps to complete the exercise:

1. Define the **supply_vault** and the **fee_vault**.
2. Create a fungible resource using the **ResourceBuilder::fungible()** method. Define define initial supply.
3. Initialize the **supply_vault** from the fungible resource **bucket** and initialize the **fee_vault** as an empty **XTR** vault.
4. Add access rule which allows anyone to call the **withdraw** method
5. Implement the **get_balance** method: Create a function that returns the balance of the **supply_vault**.
6. Implement the **withdraw** method: Create a function that verifies if the fee amount is adequate, deposits it into the **fee_vault**, withdraws the requested amount from the **supply_vault**, and returns the withdrawn tokens as a **Bucket**.

## Exercise 3: Non-Fungible Resource

Implement functionalities to manage a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) resource. The component allows to withdraw a requested token from vault, mint an NFT and deposit it into **nft_vault**. Follow these steps to complete the exercise:

1. Create a Non-Fungible resource with two NFTs in a new vault named **nft_vault**
2. In **withdraw** method, withdraw requested token from the **nft_vault** and return the **Bucket**
3. In **mint_non_fungible** method, mint an NFT providing **MyData** struct **data** and deposit it in the **nft_vault**

%}

{% include toggle-solution.html id="3_c"
header="Toggle step 3"
code="07_exercises/3_c.rs"
%}

## Exercise 4: Confidential Resource

Implement functionalities to manage a Confidential Token resource. The component allows the withdrawal of confidential tokens after verifying a flat fee is paid, depositing the fee into **fee_vault**. The **mint_confidential** method mints new confidential tokens and deposits them into **confidential_vault**. Follow these steps to complete the exercise:

1. Create a confidential resource with an initial supply. Create and set **confidential_vault** and empty **fee_vault**
2. In **withdraw** method, withdraw from confidential vault and return the **Bucket**.
3. In **mint_confidential** method, mint confidential tokens and deposit them in the **confidential_vault**
